After looking at the source code.

var pass = unescape("unescape%28%22String.fromCharCode%2528104%252C68%252C117%252C102%252C106%252C100%252C107%252C105%252C49%252C53%252C54%2529%22%29");

Now using javascript function to evaluate variable pass.

pass1 = eval(pass)

Result => pass1 = String.fromCharCode(104,68,117,102,106,100,107,105,49,53,54)

Now again evaluate pass1.

pass2 = eval(pass1)

Result => hDufjdki156

pass2 is the required password.
